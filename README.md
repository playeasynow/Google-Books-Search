# Google Books :book:
UT Austin Coding Bootcamp | Unit 20 MERN \
v1.0 \
Orig. Deployment - January 15, 2019

# Challenge
Build our first app using the entire MERN stack! Additionally, use the Google Books API to retrieve their library. This was very tough - having to think through the react app and setting up a server was a challenge, but I'm happy with the outcome. Enjoy!

Here's how it works:

- Clone the repo to your local server
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- Type in the name of a book, any book, and see the results. Save any of the books you find intersting. Navigate to the "Saved Books" page and see what books you kept. 
- Have fun!

The app uses the entire MERN stack. A very fun way to start playing with MERN concepts especially!
